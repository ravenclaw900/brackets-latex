This extension provides support for typestting documents in LaTeX within Brackets.

##Prerequisites

* Corresponding programs for viewing .pdf, .ps or .dvi files (depending on the output selected in the settings dialog).

##Features
* Enhances the brackets environment for editing and compiling LaTeX documents.
* LaTeX keyword highlighting (using the CodeMirror stex mode)
* Compilation of latex documents using latex, pdflatex, pslatex, xetex, xelatex or bibtex
* Code hints for latex keywords and document labels when typesetting documents
* Dialog for configuring where to find the TeX distribution to use for compilation
* Compile from any file in a multi-file project by including `%!TEX root=../root.tex` at the first line in every included file. Alternatively, set the `Main file` option in the `Settings Dialog`.
* Compilation automatically triggers bibtex if there is a `\bibliography{bibfile}` entry in the main document.
